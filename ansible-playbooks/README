The playbooks are here to create a full-blown penetration, audit, statistics, 
or analysis hosts on top of an exisiting Fedora installations. The main purpose
of the playbooks is to enable people to create an extented version of the 
Fedora Security Lab. It doesn't matter if you want to setup a class/training
room with multiple systems or a single host, the used technique is the same.

None of the tools here violates the Fedora guidelines regarding licensing.
